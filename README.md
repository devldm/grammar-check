# GrammarCheck

Welcome to GrammarCheck's repo. This is an in progress project built to showcase my skills whilst hopefully helping myself and others practice Korean in the future.
## Tech Stack

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

## Current state

 The app can handle logins, store and fetch data from multiple tables within a hosted database and allows users to submit grammar challenges which can be viewed on the wall or in their profile.

## Next Steps

There is still a lot to add including

- Ability to visit other peoples profiles
- Adding sorting to solved challenges and the wall
- allowing users to set language levels in profile
- adding sign in options like Kakao or Naver (Currently only discord)
- Even more!
